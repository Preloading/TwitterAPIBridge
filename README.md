# Bluesky -> Twitter V1 Bridge

This custom server translates Twitter V1 requests to Bluesky for Twitter clients.

The primary target for this is the iPhone 3G with Twitter 4.2.1 

I do not recommend hosting a public instance of this software yet, as work is still being done, and credentials may be visible to the hoster.

I will not be guarenting anything. I'll try to target both bluesky & mastodon, but no guarentee yet. Right now looking like bluesky will be the primary target due to some technical challenges with mastodon

### This is not (and probably won't be for a while) a 100% accurate recreation of the twitter API
