# A Twitter Bridge
## from bluesky to twitter api v1
###### This is not affiliated with Twitter (now X) and Bluesky.

![An iPhone 3G, iPhone 4S, and Nexus 4 showing the Twitter home timeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Preloading/TwitterAPIBridge/refs/heads/main/resources/1.png)

This custom server translates Twitter V1 requests to Bluesky for Twitter clients.

# Compatibility
To see what devices and versions are compatible, look at [the compatibility list](https://github.com/Preloading/TwitterAPIBridge/blob/main/COMPATIBILITY.md)

# Public Instances

I do not recommend hosting a public instance of this software yet, as work is still being done, major breaking changes with updates that reqiure relogging are still happening, and credentials may be visible to the hoster.

Once completed, I will make a public instance of my own.

## Hosting instructions
For hosting, you can take two paths
- üê≥ Docker (recommended) - Quick & easy to deploy + easy updating
- üñ• Bare metal - Useful when developing & debugging


### üê≥ Docker (recommended)
I assume you have some competency in docker.

Docker Compose:
```yaml
services:
  twitter-bridge:
    # image: ghcr.io/preloading/twitterapibridge:main # main = releases/stable
    image: ghcr.io/preloading/twitterapibridge:dev # dev=latest commits/test version
    environment:
      - TWITTER_BRIDGE_DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite
      - TWITTER_BRIDGE_DATABASE_PATH=/config/database/sqlite.db
      - TWITTER_BRIDGE_CDN_URL=http://127.0.0.1
      - TWITTER_BRIDGE_SERVER_PORT=3000
      - TWITTER_BRIDGE_TRACK_ANALYTICS=true
      - TWITTER_BRIDGE_DEVELOPER_MODE=false
    ports:
      - "80:3000"
    volumes:
      - '/opt/twitterbridge/sqlite:/config/sqlite' # Path where the SQLite DB is stored. It is safe to remove if you aren't using SQLite for your database.
```

|Env|Function|Default|
| :----: | --- | :---: |
|``TWITTER_BRIDGE_DATABASE_TYPE``| They type of database to connect to. Options include sqlite, mysql, and postgres. |``"sqlite"``|
|``TWITTER_BRIDGE_DATABASE_PATH``| Changes where it looks for the database (Path/DSN) (see https://gorm.io/docs/connecting_to_the_database.html) |``"/config/database/sqlite.db"``|
|``TWITTER_BRIDGE_CDN_URL``| The CDN_URL is the URL where clients can access images from this server. Do not include a trailing slash. | ``"http://127.0.0.1:3000"`` |
|``TWITTER_BRIDGE_SERVER_PORT``| The port where the server is running |``3000``|
|``TWITTER_BRIDGE_TRACK_ANALYTICS``| Enables tracking of analytics (at the moment the only way to view this is by looking at the database) |``true``|
|``TWITTER_BRIDGE_DEVELOPER_MODE``| Enables extra loggging of data useful for debugging. WARNING!: DO NOT ENABLE ON A PUBLIC INSTANCE!!!! |``"/config/sqlite/scratchcord.db"``|

### üñ• Bare metal
This assumes you are somewhat competent
#### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Preloading/TwitterAPIBridge.git
```
#### 2. Duplicate and rename config.sample.yaml as config.yaml
#### 3. Configure config.yaml (edit the file, you'll see decription of what each thing does)
#### 4. Run/build
If you want to just run this in the directory when you found config.sample.yaml
```
go run .
```
If you want to build the project run this in the directory when you found config.sample.yaml
```
go build .
```
#### 5. (if building) open the executable
#### 6. (hopefully) success!

## Accuracy
This server is no where close to 100% accurate. Most of the the time this accuracy is having more values responed than what should be, and it shouldn't affect clients using this.
